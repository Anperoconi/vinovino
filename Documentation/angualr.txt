Create a new Layout

1. Create the first layout
To create a new layout in Angular:
ng b c layouts/sidebar
This will create a folder called layouts

We then need to create its module
ng g m layout/sidebar

We then create the very first component
ng g c modules/dashboard

Create a component for the dashboards page

3.- Use the first layout as a parent route component in
app-routing.module.ts and the dashboard as a child component
