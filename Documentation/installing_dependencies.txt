To install a package that is going to be used only inside one specific project like admin we need to run every add
command with the name of the project

Ex:

ng add @angular/material --project=admin

or with ioninc

ng add @ionic/angular --project=admin

Since we are unsing ioninc in the frontend and the admin project we can install the package in the root folder
